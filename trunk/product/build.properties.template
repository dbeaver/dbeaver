# Parameters describing how and where to execute the build.
# Typical users need only update the following properties:
#    baseLocation - where things you are building against are installed
#    bootclasspath - The base jars to compile against (typicaly rt.jar)
#    configs - the list of {os, ws, arch} configurations to build.  
#
# Of course any of the settings here can be overridden by spec'ing 
# them on the command line (e.g., -DbaseLocation=d:/eclipse

############## SOURCE BUNDLE CONTROL ################
# Set this property to have source bundles created and output into build repository.
# This does NOT put them in the build output (e.g., product) itself.
# Valid values are: not set, built, all.
# 		built = only source for bundles that are actually built/compiled in this run are output
#		all = all available source is collected and output
#sourceBundleMode=all

# When outputting autogenerated source bundles a feature is created to contain all the automatic
# source bundles.  Typically this feature is not needed and can be ignored. As such, it is given a default
# name and version.  These properties can be used to override the defaults.
#  sourceBundleTemplateFeature - can specify an existing feature which will be augmented to form the generated source feature
#  sourceBundleFeatureId - will be the id of generated source feature which contains all the generated source bundles, default value
#                          is sourceBundleTemplateFeature + ".source" if sourceBundleTemplateFeature is specified
#sourceBundleTemplateFeature=
#sourceBundleFeatureId=
#sourceBundleFeatureVersion=

############## BUILD NAMING CONTROL ################
# The directory into which the build elements are fetched and where
# the build takes place.

# Timestamp for the build.  Used in naming the build output
timestamp=007

#The value to be used for the qualifier of a plugin or feature when you want to override the value computed by pde.
#The value will only be applied to plugin or features indicating build.properties, qualifier = context 
#forceContextQualifier=<the value for the qualifier>

#Enable / disable the generation of a suffix for the features that use .qualifier. 
#The generated suffix is computed according to the content of the feature   
#generateFeatureVersionSuffix=true

############# BASE CONTROL #############
# Settings for the base Eclipse components and Java class libraries 
# against which you are building.
# Base location for anything the build needs to compile against.  For example,
# in most RCP app or a plug-in,  the baseLocation should be the location of a previously
# installed Eclipse against which the application or plug-in code will be compiled and the RCP delta pack.

#Folder containing repositories whose content is needed to compile against
#repoBaseLocation=${base}/repos
#Folder where the content of the repositories from ${repoBaseLocation} will be made available as a form suitable to be compiled against
#transformedRepoLocation=${base}/transformedRepos

#Os/Ws/Arch/nl of the eclipse specified by baseLocation
baseos=win32
basews=win32
basearch=x86

#this property indicates whether you want the set of plug-ins and features to be considered during the build to be limited to the ones reachable from the features / plugins being built
filteredDependencyCheck=false

#this property indicates whether the resolution should be done in development mode (i.e. ignore multiple bundles with singletons)
resolution.devMode=false

#pluginPath is a list of locations in which to find plugins and features.  This list is separated by the platform file separator (; or :)
#a location is one of:  
#- the location of the jar or folder that is the plugin or feature : /path/to/foo.jar or /path/to/foo
#- a directory that contains a /plugins or /features subdirectory
#- the location of a feature.xml, or for 2.1 style plugins, the plugin.xml or fragment.xml

############ REPOSITORY CONTROL ###############
# This section defines properties parameterizing the repositories where plugins, fragments
# bundles and features are being obtained from. 

# The tags to use when fetching elements to build.
# By default thebuilder will use whatever is in the maps.  
# This value takes the form of a comma separated list of repository identifier (like used in the map files) and the 
# overriding value
# For example fetchTag=CVS=HEAD, SVN=v20050101
# fetchTag=HEAD
