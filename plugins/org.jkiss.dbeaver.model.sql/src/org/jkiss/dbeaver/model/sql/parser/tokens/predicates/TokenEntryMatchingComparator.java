/**
 * Partial comparator implementing relaxed comparison of data carried by two token entries.
 * Also responsible for decision whether two token entries could describe the same token.
 * Establishes partial ordering on the continuity of possible token entries with respect to part of the data.
 * Can be used in case when we cannot judge about the order of some token entries because of the missing but considered meaningful part of data.
 * Note that the part of the data under partial comparison should also be the first to look at during strong comparison (implemented by the {@link ExactTokenEntryComparator}).
