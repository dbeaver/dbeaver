        <h1>Driver Manager</h1>

        <p>
            A database driver is a third-party library which provides the ability to work with specific database engines.
            Most drivers in DBeaver are JDBC (Java-Database-Connectivity) drivers provided by database vendors.
            The driver manager dialog allows you to create, delete and <a href="driver-editor.html">edit</a> driver descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the driver manager dialog you may see a driver "tree".
            Elements in top level are "Driver providers". "Driver providers" is a DBeaver plugin.
            Usually driver providers are designed for some particular database engine, for example MySQL.
            There is one exception - the "Generic" provider which allows you to work with any database using it's JDBC driver.
            Generic providers don't "know" anything about a particular database, their specific features, metadata structure, etc. It only provides a very basic interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may edit only "manageable" drivers. All drivers under the "Generic" provider are manageable.
            Specific database drivers are not usually manageable and their settings can't be change.
        </p>
        <p>
            DBeaver ships with many predefined drivers.
            Additionally, you may create your own drivers to use with DBeaver.
