        <h2>Basic settings</h2>
        <p>Here is where you may specify connection settings and properties.</p>
        <p>Some properties are required, others are optional.</p>
        <p>List of standard settings:</p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>JDBC URL</td>
                <td>Database URL. This field is editable only if the database driver doesn't have sample URL.
                    Otherwise its value will be automatically changed whene you change other connection settings.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Host</td>
                <td>Database host name</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Port</td>
                <td>Database port number. Usually this field is optional. If left blank then the default database port will be used.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Database/Schema</td>
                <td>Name of remote database/schema.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>Server</td>
                <td>Name of remote server.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td nowrap>User name/password</td>
                <td>User credentials. May be left blank for some drivers (e.g. for embedded databases)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Advanced settings</h2>
        <p>The database driver may support additional connection settings.
            Users may view a list of all available properties on the "Advanced" tab. All properties are editable.</p>
        <p>Some drivers support additional properties but don't provide a list of them.
            In this case you may find a list of available properties in driver's documentation. After reviewing the driver's documentation you may specify any number of properties under the "User Properties" element.
            Right click on it and choose the "Add new property" menu item.
