<h1>Database Navigator</h1>
Database navigator view shows all database connections in a <a href="project-navigator.html">project</a>.
When you expand connection elements, DBeaver connects to the remote database.
The connection underlying structure depends on the connection's driver.
Generally connections contain catalogs, catalog contains schemas, schema contains tables, indexes, procedures, etc.
Elements in the navigator view can be opened/edited/deleted/etc - possible additional actions are accessible through the context menu and/or toolbar.
