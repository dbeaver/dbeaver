## How to contribute to DBeaver

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted. You could try to add unit tests if you want you PR to have a value.  

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Create a [feature request](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/new?&labels=feature+request%2C+wait+for+review&template=feature_request.md) and discuss it with other users (dev team will reply your shortly).  

* If you want to contribute a feature by yourself then see [code contribition guide](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Contribute-your-code).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
