Development process
=================================

DBeaver CE sources can be checked out from https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver
There are a few other repositories (EE version, product installer, tools, DBeaver web site) which are not public.
These repositories are not required to build or work in CE version.

There are two main branches:
	- master (keeps recent stable version of DBeaver, usually result of merge with devel)
	- devel (where all current development happens)

Developers always commit/push in devel.
Pull requests should always be based on devel.

Other public branches could be created for some particular needs.

Notes:
	/dbeaver/dbeaver GitHub repository was migrated from /serge-rider/dbeaver GitHub repository.
	Which was initially imported from dbeaver SVN repository on jkiss.org site.
	As a result there were a few inconsistencies in commits history.
	Commit owners wasn't properly migrated so you will see unrecognized users in old commits.

	User "jurgen" = "serge-rider" AKA Serge Rider
	User "titou10" = "titou10titou10" AKA Denis Forveille
