	<p>November 22, 2017</p>

	<h3>Usage Of Content</h3>

	<p>THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION,
		INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
		(COLLECTIVELY &quot;CONTENT&quot;). USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY
		THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND
		CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
		BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS
		GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY
		APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
		BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
		AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE
		AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT
		USE THE CONTENT.</p>

	<h3>Applicable Licenses</h3>

	<p>
		Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse
		Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the
		Eclipse Public License Version 2.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the
		EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0</a>.
		For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.
	</p>

	<p>Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
		code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse
		Foundation source code repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in software
		modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available as downloadable
		archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Content may be structured and packaged into modules to
			facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical
			modules may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in
			fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features
			(&quot;Features&quot;).</li>
		<li>Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory
			or JAR (Java&trade; ARchive) in a directory named
			&quot;plugins&quot;.</li>
		<li>A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or
			Fragments and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a
			sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;. Within a
			Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of
			the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments
			associated with that Feature.</li>
		<li>Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included
			Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files named
			&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version
			numbers of Included Features.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
		be contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot;
		(&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and conditions governing Features and
		Included Features should be contained in files named
		&quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and
		Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or
		Module including, but not limited to the following locations:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The top-level (root) directory</li>
		<li>Plug-in and Fragment directories</li>
		<li>Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs</li>
		<li>Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of
			certain Plug-ins</li>
		<li>Feature directories</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is
		installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you
		must agree to a license (&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during
		the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features,
		the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms
		and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you
		can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the
		&quot;license&quot; property of files named
		&quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature. Such Abouts,
		Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and
		conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern
		your use of the associated Content in that directory.</p>

	<p>THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY
		REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND
		CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT
		ARE NOT LIMITED TO):</p>

	<h3>Use of Provisioning Technology</h3>

	<p>
		The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples
		of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update
		Manager (&quot;Provisioning Technology&quot;) for the purpose of
		allowing users to install software, documentation, information and/or
		other materials (collectively &quot;Installable Software&quot;). This
		capability is provided with the intent of allowing such users to
		install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information about
		packaging Installable Software is available at <a
			href="http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html">http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html</a>
		(&quot;Specification&quot;).
	</p>

	<p>You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to
		install Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling
		the applicable license agreements relating to the Installable Software
		to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning
		Technology in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning
		Technology in such a manner and making it available in accordance with
		the Specification, you further acknowledge your agreement to, and the
		acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning
			Process&quot;) in which a user may execute the Provisioning
			Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the intent
			of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an
			Eclipse-based product.</li>
		<li>During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology
			may cause third party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be
			accessed and copied to the Target Machine.</li>
		<li>Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user
			the terms and conditions that govern the use of the Installable
			Software (&quot;Installable Software Agreement&quot;) and such
			Installable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target
			Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such Installable
			Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and conditions
			that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by
			the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software
			Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the
			provisioning Technology will complete installation of the Installable
			Software.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Cryptography</h3>

	<p>Content may contain encryption software. The country in which
		you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession, and
		use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.
		BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's laws,
		regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use,
		and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.</p>
