## Running

DBeaver requires Java (JRE) 1.8+ to run.

* <b>Windows</b> and <b>MacOS X</b> installers include JRE so just use them and don't think about internals.
* On <b>Linux</b> you may need to install Java manually (usually by running `sudo apt-get install default-jre` or something similar).
* If you don't use installer (on Windows or Mac OS X) you may need to download Java (JDK) from <a href="https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8" target="_blank">OpenJDK web site</a>.
